# Instructions for Adding Institution Photos

Please add the following three images to this folder:

## Required Images:

1. **umcu.jpg** - UMC Utrecht logo or building photo
2. **wkz.jpg** - Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis (WKZ) logo or building photo  
3. **utrecht-university.jpg** - Utrecht University logo or building photo

## Image Requirements:
- Format: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`
- Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels (landscape) or 800x800 pixels (square)
- For logos: Use transparent background PNG if possible
- Make sure images are high quality but optimized for web

## Where They Appear:
Once you add the images, they will automatically display on:
- **Home page** - In the "Our Affiliations" section
- **Footer** - Logo showcase at the bottom of every page
- **Research page** - Context for institutional collaboration

## Notes:
- The images use `object-contain` so they will scale proportionally
- Dark mode compatible styling is already implemented
- If using logos, ensure they have good contrast for both light and dark backgrounds
