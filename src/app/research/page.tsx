          <p className="mb-4">
            Conceptualization Theory is a novel approach for designing systems where humans and computers can collaborate seamlessly, 
            without needing to know about each other's existence. Instead of connecting each system separately to all other systems 
            (as is often done today), this theory enables platforms where collaboration emerges automatically through shared meanings and concepts.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-6">
            Just as artificial intelligence is inspired by human intelligence, Conceptualization Theory leverages empirical research 
            into how teams and organizations naturally collaborate. By analyzing how successful collaboration works in practice, 
            we can design platforms that mimic and amplify these principles.
          </p>

              Imagine a hospital where all computer systems, apps, and specialists collaborate on patient care, 
              without anyone having programmed how they should "talk" to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's <strong>Distributed Intelligence</strong>: smart collaboration that emerges because everyone speaks the same conceptual language.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Design Principles</h3>
          
          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Core Concept</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Systems designed according to Conceptualization Theory use shared meanings built into the platform itself. 
            Just as people can collaborate because they share the same language and concepts, systems can collaborate 
            through common conceptual models.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">How It Works</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The platform is organized around three layers, all utilizing these shared concepts:
          </p>
          
          <ul className="space-y-3 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>THINK</strong> – Interpret observations and decide what needs to happen
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>COORDINATE</strong> – Create plans by aligning goals, context, and resources
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DO</strong> – Execute the plan while adapting to new circumstances
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            By connecting these layers through shared concepts, different actors—both humans and computers—can act coherently, 
            even in uncertain situations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Distributed Intelligence</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The result is <strong>Distributed Intelligence</strong>: intelligent behavior that emerges when multiple autonomous 
            components (people and systems) collaborate without central control.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">This collaboration can exist on a spectrum:</p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Integrated</strong> – Components within one platform work together as a unified whole, 
              comparable to organs in a body
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open</strong> – Independent actors collaborate temporarily or dynamically, 
              like specialists in a multidisciplinary team
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Conceptualization enables both tightly integrated and loosely coupled collaboration.
          </p>

            By observing this collaboration, we learn how shared conceptualization works, which patterns are most effective, 
            and how to translate this natural intelligence into digital platform architecture. Just as neural networks are 
            inspired by the brain, our platforms are inspired by successful human collaboration.

                A general practitioner needs information from a specialist and laboratory. 
                Each system must be connected separately with specific interfaces and protocols. 
                When a new system is added, everything must be reconfigured.

                All systems understand concepts like patient, diagnosis, and treatment in the same way.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Conceptualization Theory marks a shift from technical connections to meaning-based collaboration. 
            By building shared concepts into the infrastructure itself, systems and people can collaborate 
            without needing to know each other's internal workings.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            We are now building a platform inspired by how successful teams and organizations naturally collaborate. 
            At the same time, we continue to empirically study these patterns of distributed intelligence to continuously 
            improve our designs.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg font-semibold">
            The result: systems and people collaborating through shared meaning—just as people collaborate through shared language.
