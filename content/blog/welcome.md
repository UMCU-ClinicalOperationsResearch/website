# Welcome to Clinical Operations Research

Welcome to the Clinical Operations Research group at UMC Utrecht! Our multidisciplinary team combines expertise in clinical medicine, data science, and healthcare technology to improve patient care and clinical workflows.

## Our Focus Areas

Our research spans several key domains:

- **Smart Alarm Systems in ICU**: Our flagship focus—developing intelligent alarm management to reduce alarm fatigue and improve patient safety in intensive care units
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Developing data-driven tools to help healthcare providers make better decisions
- **Pediatric Intensive Care**: Advanced monitoring and workflow optimization in the PICU
- **Perioperative Medicine**: Optimizing surgical and anesthesia care through predictive analytics
- **Medical Digital Twins**: Creating virtual models of cardiovascular systems for personalized care
- **Healthcare Process Optimization**: Using data to streamline clinical workflows

## Smart Alarm Systems: Our Major Initiative

Alarm fatigue is one of the most pressing patient safety challenges in modern intensive care. Our team is pioneering research in intelligent alarm management, combining machine learning, synthetic data, and user-centered design to create smarter, safer ICU environments. This work is central to the Smart and Silent ICU (SASICU) initiative at Wilhelmina Children's Hospital.

## Our Mission

We believe that intelligent use of healthcare data can transform patient care. By combining clinical expertise with advanced analytics, machine learning, and thoughtful design, we aim to make healthcare safer, more efficient, and more personalized.

## What to Expect
