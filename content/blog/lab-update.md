# Team Update: Advancing Smart Alarm Research

The Clinical Operations Research group continues to grow! We're excited to welcome new team members who bring diverse expertise in technical medicine, data science, and clinical care—all contributing to our mission of creating smarter, safer ICUs.

## Recent Additions

### Master Students

We're pleased to have master students from the Technical Medicine program at the University of Twente joining our research efforts. Their unique blend of engineering and medical knowledge is invaluable for developing and testing smart alarm technologies.

### Multidisciplinary Collaboration

Our team includes:

- Anesthesiologists and intensivists with front-line ICU experience
- Technical physicians bridging technology and medicine
- Data scientists and AI researchers developing intelligent algorithms
- UX researchers ensuring our alarm systems fit clinical workflows

## Current Projects

### Smart and Silent ICU (SASICU) - Our Flagship Initiative

Our primary focus is reducing alarm fatigue in the pediatric ICU through intelligent monitoring systems. This groundbreaking project involves:

- Machine learning algorithms to classify alarm significance
- Synthetic data approaches to test new strategies safely
- Integration with the new PICU construction at WKZ
- Collaboration with medical device manufacturers
- Real-world validation of alarm reduction strategies

The SASICU project represents a unique opportunity to design a modern ICU with smart alarm management built in from day one.

### Related Research Areas

**Medical Digital Twins**: Developing cardiovascular models that complement alarm systems by providing predictive insights into patient status.

**Perioperative Decision Support**: Implementing prediction models to anticipate complications—reducing the need for reactive alarms.

**Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care**: Advanced neuromonitoring for congenital heart defect patients, with intelligent alerting tailored to this vulnerable population.

**Healthcare Process Optimization**: Understanding how alarm management fits into broader ICU workflows and quality improvement.

## Recent Milestones
